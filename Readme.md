When you press the start button a question and timer show up
The timer begins to count down.
When you press the correct answer, the question moves onto the next one.
When you press the wrong answer, time is subtracted from the countdown (which is a very bad idea to have for a quiz, as getting the wrong answers will only make the quiz take panic more and get things wrong), and the question moves onto the next one.
Once all five questions are answered; the questions dissapear and a prompt to input your name appears.
The name is saved to the localstorage on the website.
